<h2>Using Object Expressions for Anonymous Class Implementations</h2>
<p>Object expressions in Kotlin allow you to create anonymous classes on the fly, which can be particularly useful for implementing interfaces or abstract classes without the need for a full-fledged named class. This helps keep your code concise and focused, especially when you only need a specific instance with overridden methods for a short time.</p>
