<h2>Using the 'associateBy' Function for Creating Maps from Collections</h2>
<p>The 'associateBy' function is a powerful tool in Kotlin that allows you to create a map from a collection, where the keys are derived from the elements of the collection. This is particularly useful when you want to quickly access elements by a specific property. For example, if you have a list of users and you want to create a map where the user's ID is the key, you can use 'associateBy' to achieve this efficiently.</p>

data class User(val id: Int, val name: String)

val users = listOf(
    User(1, "Alice"),
    User(2, "Bob"),
    User(3, "Charlie")
)

val userMap = users.associateBy { it.id }

// Accessing a user by ID
val userById = userMap[2] // Returns User(id=2, name="Bob")
