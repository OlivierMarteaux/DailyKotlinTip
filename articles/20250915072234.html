<h2>Using the 'plus' Operator for Collection Merging</h2>
<p>The 'plus' operator in Kotlin can be used to easily merge two collections into one. This is particularly useful when you want to combine lists or sets without the need for additional library functions. Using this operator enhances code readability and simplifies collection manipulation.</p>
<pre style="background-color: #8a428a; color: white; padding: 12px; font-size: 10px; overflow-x: auto;">
val list1 = listOf(1, 2, 3)
val list2 = listOf(4, 5, 6)

// Merging two lists using the plus operator
val mergedList = list1 + list2

println(mergedList) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
