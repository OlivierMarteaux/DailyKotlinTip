<h2>Using the 'reduce' Function for Accumulating Values</h2>
<p>The 'reduce' function is a powerful tool in Kotlin that allows you to accumulate values in a collection into a single result. It takes an operation as a parameter, which is applied to each element in the collection sequentially, combining them into a single output. This is particularly useful for operations like summing numbers, concatenating strings, or even building complex data structures from a list.</p>

val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val sum = numbers.reduce { accumulator, value -> accumulator + value }
println("The sum of the numbers is: $sum") // Output: The sum of the numbers is: 15
