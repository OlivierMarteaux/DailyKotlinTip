<h2>Using the 'let' Function for Chaining Operations</h2>
<p>The 'let' function in Kotlin is a powerful tool for chaining multiple operations on a nullable object. It allows you to perform operations on the object only if it is not null, thereby reducing the need for explicit null checks. This can lead to cleaner and more concise code, especially when dealing with nullable types.</p>

val name: String? = "John Doe"

name?.let {

    println("Uppercase Name: $upperCaseName")
