<h2>Using the 'takeWhile' Function for Conditional Collection Selection</h2>
<p>
The 'takeWhile' function in Kotlin allows you to select elements from a collection as long as a specified condition is true. This is particularly useful when you want to extract a prefix of elements that satisfy a certain criterion. Once an element fails the condition, the selection stops, making it an efficient way to filter collections based on dynamic criteria.

val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
val takenNumbers = numbers.takeWhile { it < 5 }
// takenNumbers will be [1, 2, 3, 4]
