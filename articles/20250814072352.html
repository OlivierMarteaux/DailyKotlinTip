<h2>Using the 'let' Function for Resource Management</h2>
<p>The 'let' function in Kotlin is not just for null safety; it also serves as an excellent tool for resource management. By using 'let', you can ensure that resources are released properly after their usage, especially when working with objects that require cleanup, such as database connections or file handles. This approach enhances code readability and maintains clean resource management practices.</p>
