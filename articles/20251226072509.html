<h2>Using the 'take' Function for Limiting Collection Size</h2>
<p>The 'take' function in Kotlin allows you to retrieve a specified number of elements from the beginning of a collection. This can be particularly useful when you need a subset of data for display purposes, such as showing the first few items in a list. By using 'take', you can easily manage the amount of data processed or displayed, improving performance and user experience.</p>

val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
val firstThree = numbers.take(3)
println(firstThree) // Output: [1, 2, 3]
