<h2>Using the 'takeWhile' Function for Conditional Collection Subsets</h2>
<p>The 'takeWhile' function is a powerful tool in Kotlin that allows you to create a subset of a collection based on a specified condition. It takes elements from the beginning of the collection until the predicate returns false. This is particularly useful when you want to extract a portion of a list that meets certain criteria, such as filtering items until a certain condition is no longer satisfied.</p>

val numbers = listOf(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 3, 1)
val evenNumbers = numbers.takeWhile { it % 2 == 0 }
println(evenNumbers) // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
