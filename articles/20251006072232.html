<h2>Using the 'takeUnless' Function for Conditional Collection Subsetting</h2>
<p>The 'takeUnless' function in Kotlin is a useful extension function that returns a collection containing the first elements that do not satisfy a specified predicate. This can be incredibly handy when you want to create a subset of a collection based on a condition that you want to avoid. It provides a more readable and expressive way to filter collections by negating a condition.</p>

val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

// Get numbers that are not greater than 5
val filteredNumbers = numbers.takeUnless { it > 5 }

println(filteredNumbers) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
