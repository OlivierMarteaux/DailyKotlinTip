<h2>Using the 'takeLast' Function for Tail Collection Filtering</h2>
<p>The 'takeLast' function in Kotlin is a useful tool when you need to retrieve the last N elements from a collection. This can be particularly beneficial when you want to analyze or display the most recent items in a dataset, such as the last few messages in a chat application or the latest transactions in a financial app. By using 'takeLast', you can keep your code concise and improve readability.</p>

<code>
val messages = listOf("Hello", "How are you?", "What's up?", "See you soon!", "Goodbye")

println(recentMessages) // Output: [What's up?, See you soon!, Goodbye]
</code>
