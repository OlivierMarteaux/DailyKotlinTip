<h2>Using the 'takeWhile' Function for Conditional Collection Handling</h2>
<p>The 'takeWhile' function allows you to retrieve elements from a collection as long as a specified condition holds true. This is particularly useful when you want to extract a subset of elements that meet certain criteria before encountering an item that doesn't. For example, if you have a list of numbers and you want to take elements until you hit a number that is not less than 5, 'takeWhile' can help you achieve that efficiently.</p>

val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
val takenNumbers = numbers.takeWhile { it < 5 }
// takenNumbers will be [1, 2, 3, 4]
