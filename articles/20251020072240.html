<h2>Using the 'fold' Function for Reducing Collections</h2>
<p>The 'fold' function is a powerful tool in Kotlin that allows you to accumulate a value starting from an initial value and applying a specified operation to each element of the collection. This is particularly useful for aggregating results, such as summing numbers or concatenating strings. The 'fold' function takes two parameters: an initial accumulator value and a lambda function that defines how to combine the accumulator with each element of the collection.</p>

val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val sum = numbers.fold(0) { accumulator, number -> accumulator + number }
println("The sum is: $sum") // Output: The sum is: 15
