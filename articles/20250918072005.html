<h2>Using the 'associateBy' Function for Creating Maps from Collections</h2>
<p>The 'associateBy' function in Kotlin allows you to transform a collection into a map, where each element is associated with a key derived from its properties. This is particularly useful when you want to quickly look up elements based on a unique identifier. By specifying a key selector function, you can create a map where the keys are the unique identifiers, and the values are the original objects.</p>

val users = listOf(
    User(1, "Alice"),
    User(2, "Bob"),
    User(3, "Charlie")
)

// Create a map of users indexed by their IDs
val userMap = users.associateBy { it.id }

// Accessing a user by ID
val user = userMap[1] // Returns User(1, "Alice")
