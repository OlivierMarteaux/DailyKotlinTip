<h2>Using the 'flatMap' Function for Transforming and Flattening Collections</h2>
<p>The 'flatMap' function in Kotlin is a powerful tool that allows you to transform a collection of elements into a collection of collections, and then flatten it into a single collection. This is particularly useful when you have a nested structure and want to simplify it into a single layer while applying a transformation to each element.</p>
<p>For example, consider a scenario where you have a list of users, each with a list of their favorite books. You can use 'flatMap' to create a single list of all the favorite books from all users.</p>
<pre style="background-color: #8a428a; color: white; padding: 12px; font-size: 10px; overflow-x: auto;">
val users = listOf(
    User("Alice", listOf("Book A", "Book B")),
    User("Bob", listOf("Book C")),
    User("Charlie", listOf("Book D", "Book E", "Book F"))
)

val favoriteBooks = users.flatMap { user -> user.favoriteBooks }

println(favoriteBooks) // Output: [Book A, Book B, Book C, Book D, Book E, Book F]
</pre>
