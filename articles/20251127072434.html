<h2>Using the 'take' Function for Limiting Collection Size</h2>
<p>The 'take' function in Kotlin is a powerful tool for limiting the number of elements you retrieve from a collection. This can be particularly useful when you only need a subset of data, such as the first few items in a list. By using 'take', you can avoid unnecessary processing and improve performance in scenarios where only a portion of the data is required.</p>

val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
val firstThreeNumbers = numbers.take(3)
println(firstThreeNumbers) // Output: [1, 2, 3]
