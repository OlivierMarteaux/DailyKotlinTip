<h2>Using the 'takeUnless' Function for Conditional Collection Filtering</h2>
<p>The 'takeUnless' function is a useful Kotlin extension that allows you to take elements from a collection unless a specified condition is true. This can help you simplify your code by reducing the need for explicit `if` checks and making your intentions clear. It works well when you want to filter elements based on a negated condition.</p>

val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
val filteredNumbers = numbers.takeUnless { it.size < 4 }
println(filteredNumbers) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
