<h2>Using the 'let' Function for Safe Calls and Chaining Operations</h2>
<p>The 'let' function in Kotlin can be particularly useful for safely operating on nullable types while also enabling method chaining. It allows you to execute a block of code only if a value is non-null, effectively reducing the need for explicit null checks. This can lead to cleaner and more readable code.</p>

val name: String? = "John Doe"

// Using 'let' for safe calls and chaining
name?.let {
    println("Name length: ${it.length}")
    println("Uppercase Name: ${it.uppercase()}")
