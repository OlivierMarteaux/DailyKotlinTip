<h2>Using the 'runCatching' Function for Safe Exception Handling</h2>
<p>The 'runCatching' function in Kotlin is a great way to handle exceptions in a more concise and readable manner. It allows you to wrap a block of code that might throw an exception and provides a way to handle the result or the exception without the need for extensive try-catch blocks. This is particularly useful when working with operations that may fail, such as network calls or file operations.</p>

val result = runCatching {
    // Simulating a risky operation that might throw an exception
    riskyOperation()
}.onFailure { exception ->
    // Handle the exception
    Log.e("Error", "Operation failed: ${exception.message}")
}.getOrNull() // Returns the result or null if there was an exception
