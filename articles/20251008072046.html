<h2>Using the 'associate' Function for Creating Maps from Collections</h2>
<p>The 'associate' function in Kotlin allows you to transform a collection into a map, where each element of the collection is a key-value pair defined by a provided transformation function. This is particularly useful when you want to create a mapping of objects based on certain properties, such as IDs or names, while ensuring that the resulting map is easy to work with.</p>

val users = listOf("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
val userMap = users.associate { user -> user to user.length }
// userMap will be: {Alice=5, Bob=3, Charlie=7}
