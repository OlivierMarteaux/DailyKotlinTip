<h2>Using the 'let' Function for Scoping and Safe Calls</h2>
<p>The 'let' function in Kotlin allows you to execute a block of code within the context of an object. This is particularly useful for safely operating on nullable types, as it only executes the block if the object is non-null. It also helps in scoping your variables, ensuring that they are not accessible outside the block.</p>

val name: String? = "John Doe"

// Using 'let' for safe call and scoping
name?.let {
    val upperCaseName = it.toUpperCase()
    println("Uppercase Name: $upperCaseName")
}
