<h2>Using the 'takeWhile' Function for Early Termination in Collections</h2>
<p>The 'takeWhile' function is a powerful tool for iterating through collections and collecting elements until a specified condition is no longer met. This function is particularly useful when you want to process a list of items and stop as soon as a certain criterion fails. It enhances code readability and performance by avoiding unnecessary iterations over the remaining elements.</p>

code val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

val takenNumbers = numbers.takeWhile { it < 4 }
