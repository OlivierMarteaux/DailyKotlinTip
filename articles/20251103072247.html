<h2>Using the 'run' Function for Scoped Execution</h2>
<p>The 'run' function in Kotlin is a powerful extension function that can be used for executing a block of code within a specific context. This is particularly useful when you want to execute multiple operations on an object and return a result. It combines the capabilities of 'let' and 'with', allowing you to access the object directly without needing to repeat its name. This can make your code cleaner and more readable.</p>
