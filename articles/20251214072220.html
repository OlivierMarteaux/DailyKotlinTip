<h2>Using the 'associateBy' Function for Creating Maps from Collections</h2>
<p>
The 'associateBy' function is a powerful way to transform a collection into a map, where each element is associated with a key derived from the element itself. This is particularly useful when you need quick lookups based on specific properties of the objects in your collection. 
</p>
<p>
For example, if you have a list of users and you want to create a map where the user ID is the key and the user object is the value, you can use 'associateBy' to achieve this easily.

<code>
data class User(val id: Int, val name: String)

val users = listOf(
    User(1, "Alice"),
    User(2, "Bob"),
    User(3, "Charlie")
)

val userMap = users.associateBy { it.id }

// Now you can access users by their ID
val userWithId2 = userMap[2] // Returns User(2, "Bob")
</code>
