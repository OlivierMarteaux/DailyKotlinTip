<h2>Using the 'takeWhile' Function for Conditional Collection Selection</h2>
<p>The 'takeWhile' function is a powerful tool in Kotlin that allows you to retrieve elements from a collection as long as they satisfy a given condition. This is particularly useful when you want to extract a segment of a collection that meets specific criteria, effectively creating a sub-list without having to write additional loops or conditional statements.</p>
