<h2>Using the 'takeWhile' Function for Conditional Collection Filtering</h2>
<p>The 'takeWhile' function is a powerful tool to filter a collection based on a specified condition. It allows you to retrieve elements from the start of the collection until the given predicate returns false. This can be particularly useful when you want to process a sequence of items until a certain condition is met, making your code cleaner and more expressive.</p>
<pre style="background-color: #8a428a; color: white; padding: 12px; font-size: 10px; overflow-x: auto;">
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
val takenNumbers = numbers.takeWhile { it < 5 }
// takenNumbers will contain [1, 2, 3, 4]
