<h2>Using the 'let' Function for Null Safety and Scoping</h2>
<p>The 'let' function in Kotlin is a powerful tool that allows you to execute a block of code only if the object is not null. This aids in handling nullable types gracefully and reduces the risk of null pointer exceptions. Additionally, it provides a scoped context for the object, making the code cleaner and easier to read.</p>
