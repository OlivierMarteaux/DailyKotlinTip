<h2>Using the 'take' Function for Limiting Collections</h2>
<p>
The 'take' function in Kotlin allows you to retrieve a specified number of elements from the beginning of a collection. This can be particularly useful when you want to display only a subset of data, such as the top few items in a list. By leveraging this function, you can optimize your UI to show only relevant information, improving user experience and performance.

<pre style="background-color: #8a428a; color: white; padding: 12px; font-size: 10px; overflow-x: auto;">
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
val topThreeNumbers = numbers.take(3)
println(topThreeNumbers) // Output: [1, 2, 3]
