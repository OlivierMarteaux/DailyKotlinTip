<h2>Using Coroutines for Asynchronous Programming</h2>
<p>Kotlin Coroutines provide a powerful way to manage asynchronous programming in a more readable and maintainable manner compared to traditional callback-based approaches. By using coroutines, you can write asynchronous code in a sequential style, making it easier to reason about and debug. Coroutines can be used for tasks like network requests, database operations, or any long-running operations without blocking the main thread.</p>

    delay(1000) // Simulate a long-running task
