<h2>Using the 'repeat' Function for Looping with Clarity</h2>
<p>The 'repeat' function in Kotlin allows you to execute a block of code a specified number of times. This can enhance code clarity and reduce boilerplate when you need to perform repetitive tasks. It is especially useful when you want to execute a simple action multiple times without the overhead of a traditional loop.</p>

repeat(5) {
    println("This will be printed 5 times")
}
